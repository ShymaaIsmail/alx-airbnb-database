### âœ… **Testing Performance:**

* **Before Partitioning:**

  * Run a query on the original `Booking` table without partitioning.
  * Observe the query plan and execution time using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.

* **After Partitioning:**

  * Run the same query on the partitioned table.
  * Observe that the query planner should scan only the relevant partition (e.g., `Booking_2024`) instead of the entire table.

---

### âœ… **Report on Observed Improvements:**

* **Query Execution Time:**

  * Queries targeting specific date ranges execute faster because only the relevant partition(s) are scanned.

* **Reduced I/O and Memory Usage:**

  * The query planner avoids scanning unnecessary data, reducing disk I/O and memory usage.

* **Optimized Index Usage:**

  * Indexes are applied at the partition level, allowing for more focused index scans.
